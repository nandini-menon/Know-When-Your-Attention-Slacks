# Decision Tree Classifier

## Building the Model

To build this classifier, execute the following command from the current folder:-
```
python create_classifier.py
```
After this program is executed, the model is created, trained and saved as `decision_tree.sav` in this folder.

## Making Predictions

As of now, this is what the code for making predictions does:-
1. Samples random rows from `test_set.csv`
2. Predicts the output for each row
3. Shows the predictions alongside the actual output
4. Shows the accuracy

To run this program, execute the following command from the current folder:-
```
python make_predictions.py
```
